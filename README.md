NLRMashapeClient
================

An easy way to call Mashape APIs

### Motivation

When calling some API provided via Mashape, you can use the request example they provide. The problem is, that most developers are (at least I am :smiley:) more familiar with AFNetworking than with [Unirest for Objective-C](http://unirest.io/objective-c), used in their example. Not only this, but the `success`/`failure` completion blocks and `AFHTTPSessionManager`, and the whole structure of `AFNetworking` are much better. For this reason, I decided to build a Mashape client on top of `AFNetworking`.

### Usage

Let's take as an example ["Ultimate Weather Forecasts"](https://www.mashape.com/george-vustrey/ultimate-weather-forecasts), a free API that return weather conditions. After you login to Mashape and have at least one application, you will get a `Mashape Key` for each app to make the requests for this app.

First, declare it as a property of your controller. The ideal would be to have it as a singleton in your networking classes, but for the matter of this example, I'll just show as a property of some controller:

```
@property (nonatomic, strong) NLRMashapeClient *weatherMashapeClient;

```

Then, initialize the client. The API name is the part:

```
self.weatherMashapeClient = [[NLRMashapeClient alloc] initWithAPIName:@"george-vustrey-weather" mashapeAppKey:@"THE-KEY-FOR-YOUR-APP"];
```

For each Mashape API you will use, you should use one instance of `NLRMashapeClient`. **After your client is initialized correctly, you are done with configuration, and you can make as many calls as you wish, without needing to set the headers, keys, only what matters: the endpoint and parameters!**

For example, if the `GET` examplified is `https://george-vustrey-weather.p.mashape.com/api.php`, and the parameter is `location`, you just call:

```
    [self.weatherMashapeClient GET:@"api.php" parameters:@{@"location" : @"Tel Aviv"} success:^(NSURLSessionDataTask *task, id responseObject) {
        NSLog(@"%@", responseObject);
    } failure:^(NSURLSessionDataTask *task, NSError *error) {
        NSLog(@"%@", error);
    }];
```

For a single call, the Objective-C example provided by Mashape is much simpler. But if you need to make more than one call, want to pass the parameters in a dictionary, want to use `NSURLSession`, and are familiar with `AFNetworking`, so this was made for you :heart_eyes:!

If you want to play more with this, you can just use the example project (it requires [CocoaPods](www.cocoapods.org) and running `pod install` before running).

### Installation

Definitely, the best way to use `NLRMashapeClient` is with CocoaPods.

Add to your podfile the following line:
